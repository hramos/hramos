Héctor has spent his career building the kind of developer tools that change how entire ecosystems ship software. He’s a computer engineer with 20 years of experience across infrastructure, mobile, and AI, including a decade at Meta working on open source development for React Native. Before that, he was one of the earliest team members at Parse (acquired by Meta/Facebook), shaping developer advocacy and working tirelessly to build brand awareness for one of the fastest growing developer tools of all time.

Today he’s founder and CEO of [Wallfacer](https://wallfacer.ai), the cross-platform control plane for AI-driven software development. Wallfacer gives small teams the ability to direct and audit hundreds of AI coding agents with the same rigor Fortune 500 companies apply to human engineers — turning five-person startups into engineering orgs that operate like 500. 

Before Wallfacer, Héctor was a founding engineer at Groupthink, building real-time AI collaboration tools in React and React Native. Originally from Puerto Rico, he’s now based in the Bay Area, where he still tinkers on systems for fun — from a backyard observatory for deep-sky astrophotography to a rooftop plane tracker.
